              <p>Are You Experienced is the debut studio album by the Jimi Hendrix Experience. Released in 1967, the LP
                was an immediate critical and commercial success, and it is widely regarded as one of the greatest
                albums of all time. The album features Jimi Hendrix's innovative approach to songwriting and electric
                guitar playing which soon established a new direction in psychedelic and hard rock music.</p>

              <p>Axis: Bold as Love is the second studio album by the Jimi Hendrix Experience. Track Records first
                released it in the United Kingdom on December 1, 1967, only seven months after the release of the
                group's highly successful debut, Are You Experienced. In the United States, Reprise Records delayed the
                release until the following month. The album reached the top ten in the album charts in both UK and USA.

            <li class="box_1">Axis: Bold As Love's scheduled release date was almost delayed when
              Hendrix lost the master tape of side one of the LP, leaving it in the back seat of a London taxi. With the
              deadline looming, Hendrix, Chas Chandler, and engineer Eddie Kramer remixed most of side one in a single
              overnight session.</li>
            <li class="box_2">Hendrix stated that the cover would have been more appropriate had it highlighted
              his Native American heritage.</li>
